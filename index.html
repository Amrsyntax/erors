    <h1 style="text-align: center; color: #EFB036;">Full-stack developers</h1>
    <p style="color: blanchedalmond; text-align: center;">have a high level of competency in both frontend and backend languages. They are skilled in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, NodeJS, ExpressJS, Django, and PHP. Equally, full-stack developers understand various database management systems (DBMS) like MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and more</p>

        <thead>
            <td>Full stack development is the process of developing both the frontend and backend of applications. Any application has a frontend (user-facing) component and a backend (database and logic) component. The frontend contains the user interface and code related to user interactions with the application. The backend contains all the code required for the application to run, including integrations with data systems, communicating with other applications, and processing data.</td>

However, full-stack development combines both disciplines—meaning teams can build applications from start to finish in an integrated and cohesive manner. A full-stack application is a software application that encompasses both frontend and backend in a single code base. </td>
